## Description
RunAway is an endless runner Android game built on Unity. The player controls a character who is continuously running. They have to dodge obstacles and collect coins to
increase their score. The game ends when the player crashes into an obstacle. It is an infinity runner-type game with the camera following the character. The character can move left or right to dodge obstacles. They can also jump. The farther the player runs, the more the score. There is also a login feature through which the player's score gets stored. Players may also choose to view their Stats such as high scores,
the longest distance run, or the total coins collected.

## Technology stack

1. Scripting Language: C#
2. Platform: Unity (2020.3.3f1)
3. Database: Firebase

## Applications
Popularized by mobile games like Temple Run and Subway Surfers, the endless running type of game is an extremely simplistic spin on the larger "platform" genre where a player has limited control over a character that is constantly moving forward. Our project is a fun, free to play game that is enjoyable for all ages.

## What did you learnt from this project

1. Amartya Jayawant Patil - This one is my first unity project, I don't have much experience in the unity but I like the logic the game works  and it looks in the cool graphics. And Here we used the firestore to set the user score , update the data , save it this one is most challenging part and obviously getting designs of characters this one is also challenging task.
2. Devayani Shivankar - I explored the URP and HRDP Templates extensively before I actually started working on this. Went through the new updates that Unity has provided and got to know about the innumerable features that it provides, including shader graphs, particle systems and character animations. Integration with Firebase was exhausting but we got help and made it through.
3. Vaishnavi Jarwal - Game development has always been the exciting thing to me. I always wanted to develop a game that was fun to play. I learnt a lot about unity game engine . This was one of the first experiences in game development and so I got to know how the general games are developed(this is a real challenging task), right from creating animations and shaping the characters to the whole final touchup of the game. Most fascinating thing was working with a team and mentors, because that really had a impact on the way I worked. This unity project was really a exhilarating experience for me.I understood the logic behind the development of games and how to use unity game engines and link it to firebase.It was a whole new domain for me and I am glad I learned a lot from it.
4. Navya Sharma - I learnt the fundamental techniques in Unity development, such as Adding and manipulating GameObjects and their Components, Scripting, UI, and much more. I learnt to model and make textures. In addition to becoming familiar with the Unity editor and workflow, I learnt how to create new C# scripts and do some simple programming.
5. Reshmika Sreenath Nambiar - I learned how to use the Unity game engine to make games. I understood how the process for creating a game works, from the creation of models and animations, to controlling the characters. I also learned how to calculate and store the scores and how to link games to a database like Firestore. I was new to game development, so I learnt a lot.

## Future scope
We can:
* Add more characters. 
* Add more actions like rolling/ducking. 
* Collectibles other than coins, such as power-ups and other items can also be added. 
* Our initial plan was to have the character be a mermaid in water who turns into a human on land. So, this mermaid scene will also be added in the future.
