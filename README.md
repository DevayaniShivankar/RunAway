## Description
RunAway is an endless runner Android game built on Unity. The player controls a character who is continuously running. They have to dodge obstacles and collect coins to
increase their score. The game ends when the player crashes into an obstacle. It is an infinity runner-type game with the camera following the character. The character can move left or right to dodge obstacles. They can also jump. The farther the player runs, the more the score. There is also a login feature through which the player's score gets stored. Players may also choose to view their Stats such as high scores,
the longest distance run, or the total coins collected.

## Technology stack

1. Scripting Language: C#
2. Platform: Unity (2020.3.3f1)
3. Database: Firebase

## Applications
Popularized by mobile games like Temple Run and Subway Surfers, the endless running type of game is an extremely simplistic spin on the larger "platform" genre where a player has limited control over a character that is constantly moving forward. Our project is a fun, free to play game that is enjoyable for all ages.

## What did you learn from this project

1. Amartya Jayawant Patil - 
2. Devayani Shivankar - 
3. Vaishnavi Jarwal - 
4. Navya Sharma - 
5. Reshmika Sreenath Nambiar - I learned how to use the Unity game engine to make games. I understood how the process for creating a game works, from the creation of models and animations, to controlling the characters. I also learned how to calculate and store the scores and how to link games to a database like Firestore. I am new to game development, so I learnt a lot.

## Future scope
We can add more characters. We can also add more actions like rolling/ducking. Collectibles other than coins, such as power-ups and other items can also be added. Our initial plan was to have the character be a mermaid who turns into a human on land. So this mermaid scene can also be added in the future.
